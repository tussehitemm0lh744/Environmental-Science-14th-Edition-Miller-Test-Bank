  * ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE inspires and equips students to make a difference for the world. Featuring sustainability as their central theme, authors Tyler Miller and Scott Spoolman emphasize natural capital, natural capital degradation, solutions, trade-offs, and the importance of individuals. As a result, students learn how nature works, how they interact with it, and how they can use various scientific principles based on how nature has sustained life on the earth for billions of years to live more sustainably. Engaging features like "Core Case Studies, and "Connections" boxes demonstrate the relevance of issues and encourage critical thinking. Updated with new learning tools, the latest content, and an enhanced art program, this highly flexible book allows instructors to vary the order of chapters and sections within chapters to meet the needs of their courses. Two new active learning features conclude each chapter. "Doing Environmental Science" offers project ideas based on chapter content that build critical thinking skills and integrate scientific method principles. "Global Environmental Watch" offers online learning activities through the Global Environment Watch website, helping students connect the book's concepts to current real-world issues.
